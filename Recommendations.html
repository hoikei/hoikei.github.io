      <p class="text-left">It is noticed that the demographic of the data collected skews towards the females. Hence it is suggested that StarHub host a “Family Day”, that centres around challenges that involve specifically father and child. An obstacle course or photo frame making challenge would suffice. This day out should include a photo booth area where StarHub can put up a backdrop, and get people to post with the hashtag #StarHubFamilyTime. A component that could be included is “best family identity”. The idea of this mass events it that it brings awareness to the existence of this particular hashtag.</p>

      <p class="text-left">Hold promotional events at the park instead of the typical shopping center to target the families with children segment. Our analysis of instagram posts by this segment has shown that they like to post pictures and spend time with their children in the park instead of shopping centers and convention halls. Thus, to attract this segment of people, Starhub should hold their promotional events in the park instead as the chances of having families with children in the park is higher than in the shopping malls.</p>

This could be themed around the tagline “This is their Childhood, what was yours?”. Of which to market their challenge, StarHub can approach the owners of 2mamas4kids on Instagram to feature sensory play. To participate in the contest, the user will of course have to follow StarHub on Instagram, and use a specific hashtag to allow for StarHub to view their posts. The winner of the best post gets a set of sensory play items. This promises Starhub more followers, and unpaid advertising. </p>

Singaporean families love to capture their children’s birthday as they want to capture their children growing process. 
Therefore, Starhub might want to collaborate with bakeries in their birthday cakes. For every birthday month of Starhub customer’s children birthday, provide them with a free birthday cake.

Therefore, we can create an Instagram photo contest with a topic called: “Proudest memories with your children”. Looking at captions written by the target audience, they would want to participate as participating in this they can get a chance to show off their children to even more people online. Prizes can be given to the top 5 posts voted by the public or judged by Starhub personnel or by the amount of likes on the photos.

Verizon partnered with popular photographers who travel around the world, always post amazing scenic view pictures on Instagram. Verizon reposted these posts and these posts have a higher number of likes than normal posts in average. These posts are also targeting users who travel a lot, because Verizon targets internationally, and these photographers who travel around also use Verizon service. Starhub can use such marketing strategy to maintain the social media platform. </p>

      <p class="text-left">This sees one big photo split into nine separate posts. It captures the attention of the new user when they scroll through the company/ personality’s feed for the first time. However this might be seen as spam, hence it is a good idea to use Hootsuite or any other applications to schedule these posts at times where you followers are not as active, e.g. at 3am. </p>

      <p class="text-left">Starhub recently did a Facebook post advertising for Sony Xperia XZ. Whilst it is a good idea to feature the functionalities of the phone, Starhub can consider some product placement, such as the below done by AT&T as well. These posts are through the point of view of the user utilizing the devices that AT&T covers. Being a telecommunications company, Starhub can easily adapt this look for a campaign. </p>

     <h3 class="text-left">ALPHABETICAL POSTS</h3>
      <p class="text-left">Alphabetical post is where posts related to an alphabet. in this case, the company posted the various attractions in different countries. These countries are all countries that they provide flights to. For example, they have flights to philippines so they did a post for the letter “Y” for the Yapak Beach in Boracay, Philippines.
In Starhub’s case they could post images of remote countries that you can get cell service in. For example, they could post a scenic picture of a phone in a country that is very remote like Fiji or Africa. This will show that even in distant and peculiar countries Starhub users can get cell service.

      <p class="text-left">Butterworks is a local youtuber where they showcase their talent in the form of moving visual. This video enables users to interact together with the video by placing their thumb on the middle of the video. It simulate the action that the video wants to portrait the the users. 
Starhub can follow this concept by coming out with a shorter video for instagram that enables both parents and their children to be engaged in the video. It also able to simulate the upcoming new devices or even existing devices they want to promote to their customers.
